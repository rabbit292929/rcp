## Today's plan {#aim}

## Aim
* Learn about `git rebase`
* Learn about `git fetch` and `git merge`
* Learn about staging and unstaging files
* Hands-on practice
* Industry talks

## Rebase

In git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another:

1. `git merge`
2. `git rebase`

## Merging branches using `git merge`

If we use `git merge` to combine diverging branches, we will have a non-linear history.

::: {.column width='50%'}

## Question

In which situation can we merge branches and have a _linear_ history?
:::

## Rebase

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits from a branch onto another branch.

* Rebasing is most useful and easily visualised in the context of a feature branching workflow
* Rebasing changes the _base_ of your branch from one commit to another, making it appear as though you'd created your branch from a different commit.

::: {.callout-important}
Rebasing moves an entire branch to another location in the repository
:::

It can create a cleaner history if you don't want merge lines everywhere.

## Rebase in practice {.smaller}

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is `feature`:

```
          E<---F<---G feature
         /
    A<---B<---C<---D main
```    

If we want to rebase the commits in the `feature` branch into the main branch, we need to do the following:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='50%'}
* `git checkout feature` *and*
* `git rebase main`

or

* `git rebase main feature`
:::
::: {.column width='50%'}
```
        feature    E'<--F'<--G' 
                  /
 A<---B<---C<---D main
 ```
:::
:::

::: {.center .fragment}

which results in:

 ```
    A<---B<---C<---D<---E'<--F'<--G' main
 ```
:::

## Rebasing can be dangerous

![](images/rebase.png){fig-align="center"}

## Git rebase and merge

* Merging is a non-destructive operation. The existing branches are not changed in any way, and this avoids all the potential problems of rebasing.

* Rebasing moves the entire `feature` branch to begin on the tip of the main branch, incorporating all of the new commits into main.
* Rebasing rewrites the projecth istory by creating brand nwe commits for each commit in the original branch, giving a cleaner history
* _However_, this creates problems with safety and traceability

::: {.callout-caution}
## Golden rule for `rebase`

Never use it on public branches (such as `main`) in collaborative projects.
:::

## More on branching

Imagine that you are working on your local repository and  a collaborator has created a new branch in your remote repo.
You are currently working on your local repo and want to have a look at the new branch. That means that the local repo and your remote repo have [diverged]{.monash-green2}. That is, both the local and remote repositories are **not currently synchronized.**


- To synchronize your work: `git fetch origin`
- `git fetch origin` looks where `origin` is and fetches any data from it that you don’t yet have.
- It also updates your local database repo, moving your origin/main pointer (HEAD) to its new, more up-to-date position. [However, it does not move the HEAD of your local repository]{.monash-green2}

## About remotes

Note: If a git repo contains more than one `remote`, then `git fetch` will fetch all the changes from **all** remotes.

To fetch only one, use `git fetch origin` (or whatever remote you are after).


# Why use fetch?

![](images/fetch1.png){fig-align="center"}

`origin/main` is the remote tracking branch, which provides information about where the main branch is in origin

## How does fetch work?
 
![](images/fetch2.png){fig-align="center"}

`git fetch` downloaded the new B commit however our local working directory is not updated, and the head of our main branch is still pointing to commit A.

## How do we merge those branches?

We need to combined main branch with the remote tracking origin/main branch. How?

::: {.fragment}
#### By merging! {.center}
:::

::: {.fragment}
First, we need to move in the `main` branch and then merge `origin/main`

```
git checkout main
git merge origin/main
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
If the branches have not diverged, we can merge without conflict via a 'fast merge'.

If the branches have diverged, we will need to resolve conflicts.

You can check the status of the local and remote branches by using `git branch -vv`
:::

## Very useful commands for fetching

- `git remote` lets you create, view, and delete connections to remote repositories.
- `git branch -vv` allows you to check the status of your local and remote branches in relation to each other.
- `git fetch` `origin` fetches the changes from remote origin
- `git branch -a` lists all the branches available in the local repository +  all the branches fetched from the remote. 

::: {.callout-tip}
The branches fetched from the remote origin would be preceded by remotes/origin/

# Trivia

- 9 questions 5min

- 1 team challenges 10min

- 5 questions  + 2 Drawing challenges 10min

# A speed quiz!

## Challenge: 10 minutes

As a team get organize to do the following:

1. Create a public repository that contains a README file.

2. Create a pull request where one of the team members suggest a modification of the README file.

3. Successfully incorporate the pull request.



## Questions and drawing challenge: 5 minutes

1. What is the Git command to merge the current branch with the branch called "Mybranch"?

2. What is the Git command to delete the branch "Mybranch"?

3. What is the Git command to get all the change history in the remote repository "origin"?

4. Git pull is a combination of?

5. Draw a situation where a conflict between different branches will arise?

6. Draw a situation where a conflict between your local and your remote repository will arise?


## Challenge: 10 minutes

As a team get organised to do the following:

1. One of the members creates a public repository using the standard Rstudio Quarto template. After committing those changes to the remote repository, please invite the other members.
2. Each team member creates an individual branch in which they will need to add a file name as *studentname.R*.
3. Merge all the branches into the main branch.
4. The main branch should contain the README file and all the files that each of the team member has created.
